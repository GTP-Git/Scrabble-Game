To-Do List

1) MCST (Monte Carlo Search Tree). Or, at least a 2-ply look-ahead simulation.

2) Get Save/Load working (works now when I load a saved game in my program, but not when I load into, say, Quackle

3) Get Endgame Solver working

4) Add more strategy heuristics

  Board dynamics
  Offense/Defense
  Leading/Trailing
  Hot Spots


6) Ability to specify a rack, like in Quackle, useful for study and repeatability

7) Play Again after 8-Letter Bingo should just run the game again, not go back to the Main screen.

8) Racks should be alphabetized automatically, this was working but broke



11) On Batch statistics printout, within each individual game provide a working link that goes to the game in question.

12) Save Batch statistics to a Google Sheets. I asked Gemini about this and is easily implemented, but requires OAuth flow, etc. I already have account set up so just need to add sheet ID, etc.

13) In Suggest and All Words, if bingo, show probablilty.

10) Make length in Power Tiles mode 2-5 checked by default.

9) Make Endgame Solver checkbox unchecked by default

5) Bingo, Bango, Bongo bingo finding practice
