To-Do List

1) MCST (Monte Carlo Search Tree). Or, at least a 2-ply look-ahead simulation.

2) Get Save/Load working

3) Get Endgame Solver working

4) Add more strategy heuristics

  Board dynamics
  Offense/Defense
  Leading/Trailing
  Hot Spots

5) Bingo, Bango, Bongo bingo finding practice

6) Ability to specify a rack, like in Quackle, useful for study and repeatability

7) Play Again after 8-Letter Bingo should just run the game again, not go back to the Main screen.

8) Racks should be alphabetized automatically, this was working but broke
