To-Do List

-- Get Save/Load working (works now when I load a saved game in my program, but not when I load into, say, Quackle

-- Get Endgame Solver working

-- Add more strategy heuristics

  Board dynamics
  Offense/Defense
  Leading/Trailing
  Hot Spots


-- Ability to specify a rack, like in Quackle, useful for study and repeatability

-- Play Again after 8-Letter Bingo should just run the game again, not go back to the Main screen.

-- Racks should be alphabetized automatically, this was working but broke

-- On Batch statistics printout, within each individual game provide a working link that goes to the game in question. This means each game in a batch is saved automatically before going to the next.

-- Save Batch statistics to a Google Sheets. I asked Gemini about this and is easily implemented, but requires OAuth flow, etc. I already have account set up so just need to add sheet ID, etc.

-- In Suggest and All Words, if bingo, show probablilty.

-- Show difference between the predicted opponent average move and the actual opponent move. Collate those stats on the Batch stats file. And in the end-of-game stats.

-- Calculate how good a draw is, based on the tiles drawn compared to the tiles in the pool.

-- Allow for paste functionality in the Load Game text box

-- Allow different AI strengths. From best to worst:

  1. My Strength Is Ten-Fold
  2. I was National Champ in 1989. I Hardly Ever Think About It Anymore
  3. I See You Play Scrabble. I Play A Little Scrabble Myself
  4. DEI

-- Allow user to specify simulation parameters per AI player, like how many words to consider, how many simulations per word., etc.

-- Remove debug print for rack tile movement

-- Score Preview text encroaches on the Hint button. Hint does the same thing as Suggest, so just remove it.



__________________    DONE    __________________

-- Make length in Power Tiles mode 2-5 checked by default.

-- Make Endgame Solver checkbox unchecked by default

-- Bingo, Bango, Bongo bingo finding practice

-- MCST (Monte Carlo Search Tree). Or, at least a 2-ply look-ahead simulation.

-- Change exchange logic. Don't have a minimum score to activate, and don't require the exchange to be x points better. If it's better, it's better.
