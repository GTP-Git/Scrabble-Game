To-Do List

1) MCST (Monte Carlo Search Tree). Or, at least a 2-ply look-ahead simulation.

2) Get Save/Load working

3) Get Endgame Solver working

4) Add more strategy heuristics

  Board dynamics
  Offense/Defense
  Leading/Trailing
  Hot Spots

5) Bingo, Bango, Bongo bingo finding practice

6) Ability to specify a rack, like in Quackle, useful for study and repeatability

7) Play Again after 8-Letter Bingo should just run the game again, not go back to the Main screen.

8) Racks should be alphabetized automatically, this was working but broke

9) Make Endgame Solver checkbox unchecked by default

10) Make length in Power Tiles mode 2-5 checked by default.

11) On Batch statistics printout, within each individual game provide a working link that goes to the game in question.

12) Save Batch statistics to a Google Sheets. I asked Gemini about this and is easily implemented, but requires OAuth flow, etc. I already have account set up so just need to add sheet ID, etc.
